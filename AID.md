# Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Statement

This repository includes a disclosure statement in accordance with Kari D. Weaver’s Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework for transparency in the use of AI tools during project development.

## AID Statement

Artificial Intelligence Tool: Claude 4.5 (Preview instance) was used continuously during the development process. Version details and access dates are available upon request;

Conceptualization: No large language models (LLMs), including Claude 4.5 or similar tools, were used at any stage of research idea generation or conceptual framing. All research ideas and high-level project planning were performed by human contributors exclusively;

Methodology: No LLMs or automated generative systems were engaged while defining research methods, experiment design, or project workflow. Methodological choices reflect solely human decision making;

Execution: Claude 4.5 was employed continuously as a coding assistant. HTML code and frontend-related assets may be partially or fully produced by Claude in direct collaboration with a human maintainer. All major code, design, and algorithmic decisions were subject to human review before inclusion in the repository;

Privacy and Security: The AI tool was used at regular intervals to scan for common coding vulnerabilities, and to suggest immediate fixes or patches in accordance with prevailing security standards. No suggested changes or edits were applied automatically; all patches underwent human verification prior to acceptance and deployment.
